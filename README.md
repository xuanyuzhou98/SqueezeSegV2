## _SqueezeSegV2_: Improved Model Structure and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Road-Object Segmentation from a LiDAR Point Cloud

By Bichen Wu, Xuanyu Zhou, Sicheng Zhao, Xiangyu Yue, Kurt Keutzer (UC Berkeley)

This repository contains a tensorflow implementation of SqueezeSegV2, an improved convolutional neural network model for LiDAR segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation for road-object segmentation from a LiDAR point cloud.

## Installation:

The instructions are tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.4 with GPU support. 
- Clone the SqueezeSegV2 repository:
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/xuanyuzhou98/SqueezeSegV2.git
    ```
    We name the root directory as `$SQSG_ROOT`.

- Setup virtual environment:
    1. By default we use Python2.7. Create the virtual environment
        ```Shell
        virtualenv env
        ```

    2. Activate the virtual environment
        ```Shell
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

- Use pip to install required Python packages:
    ```Shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Demo:
- To run the demo script:
  ```Shell
  cd $SQSG_ROOT/
  python ./src/demo.py
  ```
  If the installation is correct, the detector should write the detection results as well as 2D label maps to `$SQSG_ROOT/data/samples_out`. Here are examples of the output label map overlaped with the projected LiDAR signal. Green masks indicate clusters corresponding to cars and blue masks indicate cyclists.

## Dataset:
- First, download training and validation data (3.9 GB) from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnzgcitvppmwfuf/lidar_2d.tgz?dl=0). This dataset contains LiDAR point-cloud projected to a 2D spherical surface. Refer to our paper for details of the data conversion procedure. This dataset is converted from [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) raw dataset and is distrubited under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
    ```Shell
    cd $SQSG_ROOT/data/
    wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/pnzgcitvppmwfuf/lidar_2d.tgz
    tar -xzvf lidar_2d.tgz
    rm lidar_2d.tgz
    ```
- The synthetic dataset we build is so far the largest synthetic LiDAR dataset of road scene for autonomous driving. It consistes of more than 120,000 scans with point-wise semantic labels. To get our synthetic dataset, you can fill out the request for the dataset through this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o_Am34aWQiZXoEmn13zPTjOfhQah7lPCCef6VXdZ8kQ/edit). The dataset contains the synthetic LiDAR point-cloud projected to a 2D spherical surface. Refer to our paper for details of the dataset.

## Training/Validation
- Now we can start training by
    ```Shell
    cd $SQSG_ROOT/
    ./scripts/train.sh -gpu 0,1,2 -image_set train -log_dir ./log/
    ```
   Training logs and model checkpoints will be saved in the log directory.
   
- We can launch evaluation script simutaneously with training
    ```Shell
    cd $SQSG_ROOT/
    ./scripts/eval.sh -gpu 1 -image_set val -log_dir ./log/
    ```
    
- We can monitor the training process using tensorboard.
    ```Shell
    tensorboard --logdir=$SQSG_ROOT/log/
    ```
    Tensorboard displays information such as training loss, evaluation accuracy, visualization of detection results in the training process, which are helpful for debugging and tunning models
